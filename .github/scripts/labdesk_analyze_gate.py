"""Fail a build on analyzer issues in files LabDesk owns.

`flutter analyze` reports several hundred issues in this repository. Nearly all
of them are inherited from upstream RustDesk and predate the fork, so a gate
that failed on the whole report would have to be switched off to be usable.
This reads the report and fails only on issues in the files LabDesk wrote:

    flutter/lib/labdesk/**
    flutter/lib/common/labdesk_*

Everything else is printed as a count and otherwise left alone.

Usage: labdesk_analyze_gate.py <path to the captured flutter analyze output>
