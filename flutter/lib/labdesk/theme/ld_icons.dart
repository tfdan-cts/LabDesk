/// The system, and it is not negotiable per-glyph:
///   - a 24x24 box, with the drawing inside a 20x20 optical area
///   - one stroke weight, 1.75, round cap and round join, never filled
///   - square corners are radius 2; nothing is a perfect circle unless the
///     thing itself is round (a dot, a lens)
///   - horizontals and verticals sit on the half-pixel grid so they stay crisp
///     at 16 and 24
///   - one idea per glyph. Where Material draws the object, these draw the
///     action being taken on it.
