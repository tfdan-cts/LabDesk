/// The look of every modal LabDesk raises.
///
/// A dialog is the one surface in this product that appears without being
/// asked for, on top of whatever the operator was doing, and usually because
/// something needs deciding: a password, a file that already exists, a machine
/// about to be restarted. So the rules here are stricter than anywhere else:
///
///   - One frame, for all of them: a title row, a hairline, the body, and the
///     answers in a footer. A message box is not a special shape and neither is
///     a two-word confirmation — the machine being deleted goes in the body
///     like every other thing a dialog is about.
///   - The question is the first thing on the surface and it is set at heading
///     weight. The consequence sits directly under it in full sentences, not
///     behind a tooltip or a "details" disclosure.
///   - A machine's identity — an id, a hostname, a path — is set in the
///     console's data face, because that is what somebody is about to compare
///     against the sticky note in their hand.
///   - The two answers weigh the same. A filled slab beside a grey outline
///     tells a hand that is already moving which one the product would prefer,
///     and on "restart this machine" or "overwrite this file" the product does
///     not get to have a preference. What the consequential answer carries
///     instead is a tinted frame, a tinted wash and a glyph.
///   - Destructive is the one thing allowed to look different in kind: it takes
///     the console's bad-news colour on its label as well as its frame, so it
///     cannot be mistaken for the ordinary answer at a glance.
///
/// Like the other skins in this directory these pieces take plain values and
/// know nothing about the FFI or about `common.dart` — translation happens at
