/// already has one. Skipping counts because asking twice for something the

/// It asks for one thing, a server, by the two routes that provide one. It asks
/// for no permission: there is no camera prompt and no notification prompt
/// here, because nothing on this screen uses either, and a permission asked for
/// before the feature that needs it is a permission asked for without a reason.
///
/// The line about the current server is read rather than assumed. When a server
/// is configured it is named. When none is, the screen says the built in
/// default is in use and does not invent its name, because this client cannot
/// currently read the effective server back out of the core.
///
/// That line has room to grow on purpose. A default server is not only a
/// hostname: the client pins a key for it, and this screen is where somebody
/// learns which server and which key they are trusting. When there is a
/// rendezvous server to name, both belong here.
