# Changelog

LabDesk's own versions. The RustDesk core underneath is stated in the README, not versioned here.
Rules: `docs/VERSIONING.md`.

## 1.2.3 (2026-09-04)

Security fixes.

- An update is verified before it installs, on every path that installs one. LabDesk refuses to
  install a download whose bytes do not hash to a published SHA-256. The digest is read out of the release's own `SHA256SUMS`, which the build workflow now
  publishes beside the assets of every release it makes, so a client built from this commit
  can install an update; a release that carries no manifest is refused rather than installed
  unverified. The old check compared the size of any file left
  behind in the temporary directory, which every local user can write, so a file of the right
  size was reused and handed to an elevated installer unverified. A release that publishes no
  digest, the upstream GitHub releases included, no longer installs at all. Release manifests
  are signed as well, but nothing is checking those signatures yet: the pinned key in
  `src/updater.rs` is an empty placeholder and the key ceremony has not been performed.
  `docs/SIGNING.md` says what it takes to switch enforcement on.
- The heartbeat and inventory posts to lab-desk.net carry the signed-in account's token. They
  were sent with no authorization header at all, so every one of them was refused by a server
  that already required one, which is why no machine record was ever stored. The write is now
  constrained to a row that is unclaimed or already the caller's own, so one account can no
  longer overwrite another machine's row, its inventory or its public key. Console tokens now
  expire as well: the column carried a ninety day default that no code had ever compared to
  the clock.
- The settings a server may push back in a heartbeat reply are limited to a fixed list of
  session permissions. Everything that decides where this machine listens or what it dials
  (`direct-server`, `labdesk-direct-bind`, every labnet overlay key), who may connect
  (`verification-method`, `approve-mode`, `whitelist`, `id-whitelist`) and whether it installs
  code (`allow-auto-update`) sits outside that list.
- A machine enrolling in labnet reports its real public key and its real listening port. It
  sent an empty key and a fixed port before, and the key is now read without minting one as a
  side effect, so an enrolment cannot publish an identity the machine does not hold.
- A labnet session grant uses only the key the machine itself reported when it enrolled. The
  broker used to fall back to the key on the device row, which a different account could write.
  With no reported key the grant is refused with a reason, rather than issued against a key
  that may not be the machine's.
- On the direct labnet path, a machine that answers the hinted address and signs an identity
  the peer's key does not answer for ends the connection instead of carrying it. An address
  that leads nowhere, or that answers without proving an identity, still falls back to the ID
  server. A hint is dialled only as a literal IPv4 address in 100.64.0.0/10; a name, an IPv6
  address and an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address are all discarded.
- Revoking a machine's labnet enrolment deletes its open session policies before its group and
  records the revocation last, so a revoke that fails part way can be retried instead of
  leaving the machine wedged with its group still on the labnet server. Re-enrolling deletes
  the previous unused setup key rather than leaving a second key that can register a peer.
- The labnet server at nb.lab-desk.net was hardened, and each check was answered by a
  measurement taken after a reboot rather than by the configuration that was written. From the
  internet only 443/tcp and 3478/udp answer; the host firewall drops inbound by default on IPv4
  and IPv6; no container reaches the cloud metadata service or the production subnet; all three
  containers are pinned by digest, drop every capability and then regain only the few they use,
  and cannot gain new privileges;
  Traefik no longer has the Docker socket and runs on a read-only root filesystem. The Lynis
  hardening index moved from 64 to 76. `docs/LABNET-SERVER.md`.

New capability.

- labnet, an encrypted direct path between machines on the same account, on a NetBird client
  bundled beside LabDesk. One consent prompt, then a switch on This machine. A session to a
  machine that has it on goes straight to it over the tunnel, with LabDesk's own key exchange
  intact, and falls back to the ID server otherwise. The Network section holds labnets:
  standing groups a machine joins only after approving on its own screen, with a per-labnet
  full access switch. `docs/CONSOLE.md`, `docs/LABNET-SERVER.md`, `docs/THIRD-PARTY.md`.
- Telemetry collection runs in the always-on service, which is the privileged process on all
  three platforms and the only one that keeps running with nobody logged in. It samples CPU,
  memory, disk space and network counters on a cadence the server sets, writes them to a spool
  file with a hard cap that drops the oldest lines rather than filling the disk, truncates only
  after a send is accepted, and backs off by doubling up to a ceiling when the server is
  unreachable. A machine
  told it has been revoked stops collecting and deletes its spool. Enrolment is
  `labdesk --enrol --token <token>`, run elevated on an installed copy; nothing in the console
  or on lab-desk.net issues that token yet.
- The machine has a credential of its own: an Ed25519 keypair generated inside the privileged
  daemon and kept out of the configuration that is handed to the user process over IPC. The
  key file is mode 0600 on Linux and macOS; Windows has no root, so it is stored under the
  service account's profile with a narrowed access list. lab-desk.net authenticates the machine
  plane on a signature over the method, the request target, a timestamp and a hash of the body,
  and on nothing else, so a stolen console token cannot speak for a machine.
- lab-desk.net gains an organization: owner, technician and viewer roles over machines and
  fleets, with every route resolving the caller's membership and capability before it reads or
  writes, and every lookup carrying the organization alongside the row it names. Telemetry
  ingest, the machine side of labnet and an address book that serves per-fleet books and never
  returns a password sit behind it. None of it is live; see the gaps below.
- Disk health is judged in four states: ok, warn, failing and unreadable, so a disk that could
  not be asked never reports as a disk that is fine, and a disk that is degrading is not yet
  called failing. The parsers cover ATA SMART attributes and the NVMe health log page against
  committed byte fixtures, two of them deliberately malformed, and the platform layer issues DeviceIoControl on Windows and the ATA
  and NVMe passthrough ioctls on Linux. Nothing calls it and it has never run against a real
  disk; see the gaps below.
- The lab-desk.net repository gains a typecheck and test workflow; it had no continuous
  integration at all. It gates nothing yet, and less than it appears to: the workflow exists
  only on the feature branch, so it is absent from `dev`, which is the default branch and the
  one Cloudflare deploys from. `dev` also has no branch protection.
- The decisions and the architecture behind the four entries above are in
  `docs/plans/2026-09-04-002-rmm-decisions.md` and
  `docs/plans/2026-09-04-003-rmm-architecture.md`.

Known gaps, each read out of the committed code rather than assumed.

- None of the server side above is live. Production D1 has migrations `0000` and `0001`
  applied; `0002` through `0009` are pending, and that includes `0002`, which creates the
  labnet tables themselves, so labnet has never worked in production either, not only the
  organization, machine, telemetry, health engine, address book and index tables above it. A read of `d1_migrations` on 2026-09-04
  returned those two rows, zero device rows and no `machine` table.
- The desktop client's labnet calls for enrolling, reporting its address, revoking, the invite
  inbox, approving an invite and leaving a labnet still address `/api/overlay/...`, and those
  routes moved onto the signed `/agent/overlay/...` plane. In a build from this commit the
  machine side of the labnet entry above does not work. A fix is in flight.
- The health engine that evaluates rules on the server has no caller. The Worker has no cron
  trigger and no scheduled handler, and nothing outside its own test imports it. In flight.
- Fleets exist in the schema and behind `/api/org/fleets`. Nothing in the console or on
  lab-desk.net creates or manages one. In flight.
- Nothing reads disk health. The collector samples free space, not SMART, and no code outside
  the disk module calls it. In flight.
- Linux machines receive no unattended updates. The automatic check installs on Windows only,
  macOS installs from its own service path, and a Linux package installs only when a person
  accepts the root prompt. A Linux delivery package was written, reviewed as broken and
  reverted rather than shipped.
- `.github/workflows/flutter-ci.yml` analyzes the Dart sources without generating the Rust
  bridge, so a call that names a bridge function which does not exist is not caught before it
  ships.
- `src/hbbs_http/sync.rs` records a gap of its own: on Windows and macOS the process that sends
  the heartbeat can read a different profile than the one the interface signed in to, and with
  no token every post is refused. Stated in the source; not measured on either platform here.
- An update refused for a digest mismatch on the console's update button is written to the log
  and not shown on screen. The macOS extraction step is the exception: it reports its refusal
  to the dialog that is waiting on it.

## 1.2.2, 2026-09-03

- Health cards remember every reading while monitoring is on and draw CPU, memory and disk
  over the last two hours under each figure, with the time and value under the pointer.
- Machine menus carry a glyph per line; the sidebar takes focus and Enter, reports itself to
  screen readers, and Ctrl+1 to Ctrl+9 open the sections.
- A copy that is not installed is told, in the console, to install: the always-on service,
  unattended access and in-place updates exist only installed.
- Wording is the product's own: sessions require a password or your approval, allowed IPs and
  IDs, privacy screen, lock remote screen, send Ctrl+Alt+Del, port forwarding, wake on LAN.
  Linux menu and service names, Windows support links and package metadata name LabDesk and
  lab-desk.net. The Android store listing inherited from upstream is removed.
- Uninstalling the Debian package removes LabDesk's own configuration directory, not the
  upstream project's.
- Release files are named `labdesk-<version>-<arch>.<kind>` on every platform, and the
  updater asks for them by that name. lab-desk.net serves older releases under the same
  naming and still answers a 1.2.1 asking under the old one.

## 1.2.1, 2026-09-03

- Updates come from lab-desk.net. LabDesk checks for a new version on start and once a day,
  shows a banner in the console, downloads the build the site administrator made public, and
  installs it in place: silently on Windows, through the existing path on macOS, and on Linux
  with one root prompt for a deb or rpm package. AppImage and flatpak copies get the download
  page instead.
- The LabDesk account is global. Sign-in, address book and device presence go to lab-desk.net
  whichever server profile is active; the per-profile API server field is no longer edited.
- The console's machine links no longer raise session dialogs in the main window; a failed
  link reports its reason ("ID does not exist") where it used to guess at the password, and no
  session error can close the application.

## 1.2.0, 2026-09-02

The first version the binaries carry themselves; until now they reported the core's `1.4.9`.

- The console holds a headless connection of its own to each machine, authenticated with the
  saved password. Health, the Terminal section, the tools and automation all run over it; a
  terminal window is no longer required.
- Fleet gains a Health tab: every machine as a card, monitoring per machine, read every 30 s.
- Sessions: chat with every open outgoing session from the console, through the session's own
  chat, so the floating chat and the console show one conversation.
- This machine: a display name, shown to machines you connect to instead of the OS user name.
- Tools: services, processes, event log, software, disk, network, power, and a library of your
  own scripts, run on one machine or many; per-row service and process actions.
- Automation: rules with triggers (came online, went offline for N minutes, metric above,
  uptime above, schedules) and actions (run command, notify, wake, monitor, open session).
  They run while LabDesk is open on this machine.
- Reachability is polled again, every 4 s; Refresh shows a real busy state and stamps the
  server's last answer.
- The wait-for-acceptance dialog names the machine and says why it is waiting.
- The sidebar's server-profile control opens the profiles; the sidebar is narrower.
- The remaining stock-RustDesk surfaces were reworked: dialogs, the file-transfer window, the
  connection manager, the session toolbar, the installer, This machine, and the console's own
  glyphs throughout.
- Probes and tools read what a PTY actually delivers on both platforms (bash's bracketed-paste
  escape on the first line; PowerShell's continuation prompt; ConPTY turning tabs into spaces).

Known: chat with machines connecting to this one is not shown in the console (the connection
manager is a separate process); Terminal and Actions still pick their machine on Fleet.

## 1.1.0, 2026-08-29 (console preview)

- The console becomes the application: navigation, Connect, Fleet, Health, Terminal, Actions,
  This machine and Settings behind one shell, hosting the working client widgets.
- LabDesk's own icon set and brand mark; the installer stops looking like RustDesk.

## 1.0.3, 2026-08-29

- Windows install and uninstall fixed under the LabDesk name; service config removed on
  uninstall; `--remove-service-config`.

## 1.0.1 and 1.0.2, 2026-08-27 and 28

- Build metadata debranded; one-line installers for Windows and Linux with six correctness
  fixes; the click-to-install `LabDesk-<version>-<arch>-install.exe`.

## 1.0.0, 2026-08-27

- Named server profiles, machine groups, per-machine icons, the purple theme, the LabDesk name.
