// The always-on telemetry collector.
//
// This runs in the `--service` daemon and nowhere else. That placement is the whole point:
// on Linux `--server` is launched through `run_as_user` as the desktop user
// (src/platform/linux.rs:713-717) while `res/rustdesk.service` runs `--service` as root,
// and on macOS `_service.plist` is installed under /Library/LaunchDaemons against
// `_server.plist` under /Library/LaunchAgents (src/platform/macos.rs:190-195, :339-343).
// On Windows `sc create ... binpath= "{exe} --service"` carries no `obj=`, so the service
// is LocalSystem. Only `--service` is root/SYSTEM on all three, and a collector in the
// user process could neither read disk health nor keep running while nobody is logged in.
//
// The loop itself is deliberately small. It samples on a tick, writes one line per sample
// to the spool, and flushes the spool on a slower tick. Every decision worth getting wrong
// -- the hard cap, what a batch carries, what a status code means for the history on disk,
// how long to wait after a failure -- lives in `super::spool` as a pure function with
// tests. What is left here is the plumbing those functions are wired into.
