// Linux: getting the bytes the parsers in `ata` and `nvme` read.
//
// Same division as `windows.rs`: nothing here interprets a reading. The
// privileged calls hand back the same 512-byte buffers the Windows path
// produces, byte for byte, so one parser serves both operating systems.
//
// Privilege, stated rather than assumed:
//
//   * The free tier, `/sys/block` and `/sys/class/nvme`, is world readable.
//     It carries identity, capacity, rotational and sometimes an NVMe
//     temperature. It carries no failure evidence at all, which is why
//     [`super::verdict::Source::Sysfs`] on its own can only ever produce
//     `Unreadable`.
//   * `NVME_IOCTL_ADMIN_CMD` needs CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
//   * `SG_IO` with an ATA PASS-THROUGH(16) command needs CAP_SYS_RAWIO.
//
// The daemon has both because `res/rustdesk.service` runs it as `User=root`.
// In `--server`, running as the logged-in user, both privileged calls fail on
// every machine and the collector is left with the free tier.
//
// USB bridges and hardware RAID controllers usually refuse pass-through
// outright. That is `Verdict::Unreadable` with `health_source` of `none`, never
// `ok`: an enclosure that would not answer is not a healthy disk.
